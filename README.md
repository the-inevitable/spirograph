This project uses Python to create an animation of Spirograph-like drawing curves. 

spiro.py program will use Python and parametric equations to describe the motion of the program’s Spirograph’s rings and
draw the curves (which I call spiros). 

The spiros are saved as PNG image files. 

Command line options can be used to specify parameters or to generate random spiros.

Goals of this project are to:
- Create graphics with the turtle module.
- Use parametric equations.
- Use mathematical equations to generate curves.
- Draw a curve using lines.
- Use a timer to animate graphics.
- Save graphics to image files.

After running `python spiro.py` you will get N (4 used in example code) random spiros.
